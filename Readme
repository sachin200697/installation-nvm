First, we need to do a little preparation:

1. uninstall any existing versions of Node.js
2. delete any existing Node.js installation directories (such as C:\Program Files\nodejs)
3. delete the existing npm install location (such as C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Roaming\npm)
4. Download and run the latest stable installer. You can download nvm-setup.zip or nvm-setup.exe .
